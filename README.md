CougarTech-Scouting-Application
===============================

CougarTech Scouting Application or CATS (A scrambled acronym)
or CougArTech Scouting application if you think order matters,
(I just wanted to have a thematic, acronym for a name.)
is meant to be an application for scouting FIRST Robotics regionals.

It will allow for adding robot data, individual robot analysis, input of
statistics gathered from matches, editing previous data,
loading the regional schedule for robots to compete.
And ranking the robots based on multiple fields, including a custom algorithm.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've Started, finally, on the project.  It is in Python, for easy development.
It will only run in Python3. I have plans to recode the whole thing later
in another language, Java or C# most likely.


I'm starting out on the framework, which in my mind is:
The modules I'll be using to define the system,
The core integration of the modules,
A way to present the data/statistics recorded
An algorithm to rank the robots.
(And lots of bug fixes)
