CougarTech-Scouting-Application
===============================

CougarTech Scouting Application or CATS (A scrambled acronym) 
is meant to be an application for scouting FIRST Robotics regionals.

It will include a system for adding robot data initially, allowing looking at data for individual robots
loading teh regional schedule for robots to compete, editing the robot data after each game to gather preformance data.
And ranking the robots based on a rational algorithm.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've Started, finnaly, on the project.  The project is in Python, for easy development, I have plans to recode the
whole thing later in another language, Java or C# most likely.


I'm starting out on the framework, which in my mind is:
the modules I'll be using to define the system,
the core integration of the modules,
a way to present the data/statistics recorded
An algorithm to rank the robots.
(And lots of bug fixes)
